# Terraria Mobile Server (decompiled)

So yes, I spent like 4 hours with ILSpy to decompile. Had to download external libraries, which all went to VirusTotal.

The code is only for modding, porting to other systems (please do that) and educational purposes.

## WARNING:

The `Localisation` folder is __required__ to run the server.

I got only one warning during build which was: `.\Terraria\Projectile.cs(4384,5,4384,6): warning CS1522: Empty switch block`

Compiled in `.NET 8.0` and C# version `latest`.
